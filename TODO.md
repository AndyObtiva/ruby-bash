# TODO

- Support zsh (adding source call to .zshrc)
- Support Git Bash on Windows
- Extend gdr filter to support absolute paths and more-than-one-directory-jump listing
- Build a ruby-bash `cmd` TUI command for listing available commands (e.g. `gdr`)
- Implement an if Ruby command to use in the command line as a real if unlike bash's weird if
